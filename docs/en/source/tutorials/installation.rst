Installation
=============

Let's get started by setting up our environment to run this snake.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The baby version of cobra is sensitive, and it could only be happy when living with python 3.7 or newer. So please set a nice environment to make sure it is happy.

Working environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

COBRA is tested and supported on the following 64-bit systems:
- python 3.7
- linux

You will have two options to keep cobra happy:

- using docker
- building up own working environment

See more details from :ref:`environment`.

Install COBRA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Install COBRA with Python's ``pip`` package manager.
